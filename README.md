# MakeWad

Convert a folder of images into Quake1 .WAD2 Format

Here is my fork of the wadmaker, this aims to make the application a little more easy to use for newcomers.

# Getting Started

1. First you will want to clone, or download this repo.
2. Next you will want to get the latest copy of **Ruby On Rails**\
   Download Ruby here: <https://rubyonrails.org/>
3. Once downloaded, open this folder and run the file **install.bat**


1. Next you will want to place all your textures inside the textures folder, these should be of image file type formats.

   **IMPORTANT: File types must be PNG !**\
   **May work with other filetypes, but none have been tested yet.**
2. You can now run MakeWad.bat in, and it should generate your .WAD with all textures inside the wad folder.
3. You should now have a .WAD in the Quake1 WAD2 Format!
